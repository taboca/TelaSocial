Cases

 	For each second, we kick a time stamp event
  	if someone wants to add something to the current t+1
	you insert a rule for the t+1. 

	Case, a 30 seconds animation that has t=1 E=1 t=10,E2 and t=20, E3
	and repeats.

	* * 1 E1
	* * 10 E2 
	* * 20 E3 
 	
	time[secs=1] { E1 } time[secs=10] { E2 } time[secs=20] { E3 } 

	Each time event that happens in the timeline DOM storage appears and 
	goes away, to a history DOM storage, which means processed.
